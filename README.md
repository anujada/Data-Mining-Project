# Data-Mining-Project

This is the repository used to organize and build our Data Mining project as part of Riccardo Tommassini's class at INSA Lyon.

We retrieved the dataset of our project from the NASA Exoplanet Archive: https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/

The data was analyzed using techniques like clustering and clasiffication. The code for both of them is present in the Jupyter Notebooks.
